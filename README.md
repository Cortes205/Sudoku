This is a sudoku game that I made for the CAT of my grade 12 computer science class.
I learned and experimented with concepts that were new to me and have learned a lot from this project.
While it is surely not the most efficient way of making the puzzle, I am excited to further enhance my skills in the future.
I didn't have time to do this, but one thing I would have liked to add to this project is a notes system, that way you can visual what numbers are possible in each square.
